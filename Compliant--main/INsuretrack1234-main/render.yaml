# Documentation: https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec
# For Static Sites: https://render.com/docs/static-sites
#
# Repository: miriamsabel1-lang/INsuretrack1234
# Branch: main
#
# This file defines a Static Site for the INsuretrack frontend.
# buildCommand: Runs build.js which installs deps and builds with Vite
# staticPublishPath: Directory containing the built static files
#
# SPA Routing: The public/_redirects file is automatically copied to dist/
# during build and configures all routes to fall back to /index.html for
# client-side routing (React Router).
#
# IMPORTANT: Set VITE_API_BASE_URL in Render dashboard:
# Dashboard > Your Static Site > Environment > Add Environment Variable
# Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
